            <p> ARChetype CRFs are standardized, disease or syndrom-specific CRFs developed by ISARIC. They are a key component of the <a href="https://isaric.org/resources/clinical-characterisation-protocol/"> 
                ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) </a> framework, which aims to enhance global preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks. 
                These CRFs are designed to address key clinical research questions, facilitating the collection of high-quality, harmonized data across 
                different regions and healthcare settings. By focusing on priority emerging and infectious diseases—such as mpox, Dengue, COVID-19, and H5Nx—and related 
                syndromes, ARChetype CRFs support rapid, coordinated research efforts that can inform patient care and public health strategies. </p>

             <p>  ARChetype CRFs are designed to collect data on community or hospitalised patients in order to address key clinical research questions and 
                 inform better case management, contribute to the design of clinical trials, and guide public health interventions. </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Characterise the clinical epidemiology of cases, including the presenting signs and symptoms, disease progression, and clinical outcomes;
                    <li>Enable comparative clinical epidemiology between diseases, populations, and/or geographies;</li>
                    <li>Identify risk factors associated with disease presentation, progression and outcomes;</li>
                    <li>Describe the clinical management of patients, including any differences in approaches to management;</li>
                    <li>Describe diagnostic approaches and results; </li>
                     </ul>

<h1> Creation Guidelines </h1>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p> The ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) framework is a global, inclusive initiative offering a comprehensive approach for the rapid and standardised 
                characterisation of (re)emerging infectious diseases. Within this framework, ISARIC supports researchers by providing a suite of standardised tools, including protocols, 
                ARChetype case report forms (CRFs), and a CRF generator (<a href="https://bridge.isaric.org/">  BRIDGE </a>) that allows forms to be tailored to local 
                needs while ensuring consistent data collection. These tools utilise uniform questions, choices, and terminology, ensuring machine-readable, high-quality data across studies.
                Moreover,<a href="https://isaric.org/resources/data/"> ISARIC Clinical Epidemiology Platform </a> offers resources for efficient data capture and management and
                has developed an automated pipeline that can generate dashboards and results, aiding in the analysis of data and dissemination of evidence. </p>
                <p>Central coordination by ISARIC promotes streamlined communication and collaboration among researchers, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of research efforts.
                Researchers also benefit from the experience and expertise of a global network of ISARIC collaborators. This network facilitates coordinated research efforts and enhances
                the collective response to infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

            <h2>CRF Creation Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The ISARIC’s methodology for developing archetype CCP CRFs, emphasises essential stages from initial identification of the need, through to final release and establishment of 
                ongoing feedback mechanisms. </p>
               <p> <i> Please note that the guidelines will be adapted to reflect the context of the epidemic and disease.</i> </p>
               <p> <i> If you have any modifications to suggest for an existing CRF, or would like to know more about a CRF under development, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:data@isaric.org">data@isaric.org</a>.</i> </p>

                        They will consider (a) the public health impact of the disease/syndrome, (b) existing research efforts to address the objectives proposed, (c) engagement of appropriate stakeholders (d) ISARIC’s ability to add unique value to global evidence generation efforts through development of the CRF.

                        researchers who have published relevant literature on the disease, clinicians with patient management experience, data managers, related global health actors, and regulatory bodies who will be invited to provide input and ensure alignment with diverse requirements.

                        related initiatives and what parties should be involved in its development. WHO feedback will be incorporated as much as possible by iteration of the required steps above or below.</p>
